# Plant-Disease-Prediction
Plant Disease classifier using Tensorflow
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify images into different categories. The model is trained on a dataset of images and can predict the category of new, unseen images.

Features
- Image classification using a custom-built CNN model.
- Supports training and validation datasets.
- The model can predict image classes after training.
- Includes training with accuracy and loss plotting.
- Model is saved after training for future use.
- JSON file to store class labels for prediction.
